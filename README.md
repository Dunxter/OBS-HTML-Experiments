To enable desktop camera permissions in OBS, run it with the following command: `-use-fake-ui-for-media-stream`

To do so on Windows, create a new shortcut and enter the OBS executable path along with the command in the location field: `"C:\Program Files\obs-studio\bin\64bit\obs64.exe" -use-fake-ui-for-media-stream` 

(Note: This executable location is an example; it may vary on your machine)
